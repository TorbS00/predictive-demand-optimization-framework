# Predictive Demand Optimization Framework

This repository is for **learning purposes** and demonstrates a basic predictive demand and optimization framework using Python. It focuses on understanding how demand forecasting and optimization can be applied to inventory management or pricing strategies.

The project includes loading and cleaning historical data, visualizing demand trends, and using basic machine learning models to forecast future demand. Additionally, optimization techniques are applied to determine the best inventory levels or pricing based on the predicted demand.

This project is not intended for production use and should be used only for educational purposes.
